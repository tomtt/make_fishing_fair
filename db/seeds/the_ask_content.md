The ask

Small-scale fishers across Europe are calling for a level playing field in terms of access to subsidies and fishing opportunities:

- Redirect harmful fuel subsidies away from highly polluting vessels and practices towards those that are low-impact and lower emissions.

- Revise quota allocation so that it rewards fishing that supports local jobs and communities and does less harm to the marine environment.

This action is supported by Blue Ventures, Bloom, Oceana, Seas At Risk, Client Earth, Open Seas and Blue Marine Foundation with Patagonia.
