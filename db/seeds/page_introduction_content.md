Billions of public money are being spent every year to support highly polluting vessels that overfish and damage our coasts. Opportunities to fish are concentrated in the hands of industrial, high-impact fishing vessels, resulting in overfishing, driving some species to critically low levels.This is pushing the small-scale fishing sector and our coasts to breaking point – [diminishing income, age-related sector decline, closures of fisheries].

Thousands of small-scale, low impact fishers across Europe are calling on the European Commission, fishing institutions and governments to give them – as doing the least harm and generating the most jobs — preferred access to subsidies and opportunities to fish. When small-scale, low-impact fishers tread more lightly, support more community jobs and can play a role in protecting our coasts, isn’t it time we started supporting them?
