Dear [European Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans & Fisheries],

Small-scale fisheries (SSF) make up over 70% of the European fisheries sector, generating ten times more jobs and more than double the catch value for every million litres of fuel used, in contrast to large-scale, high-impact fishing. Despite this, the sector has been starved of fishing opportunities and sectoral support over decades, impacting the overall resilience of fishing communities across Europe.

**We are calling on you to address the inequalities within European fisheries management through a just transition, by ending harmful subsidies and securing small-scale, low-impact fishers’ fair access to financial support and fishing opportunities in Europe.**

The implementation 2013 Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) failed to recognise the potential of low-impact, small-scale fisheries to support livelihoods, local food systems, and socio-economic activities in coastal communities. By prioritising and providing policy support, small-scale fisheries will play a key role in addressing Europe&#39;s overfishing, preserving marine biodiversity, reducing the fishing industry's carbon footprint, and tackling socio-economic challenges in the maritime sector.

The CFP, most especially through the system used to allocate fishing opportunities and subsidies, has created a distorted sea. Harmful fuel subsidies are benefitting and maintaining larger, more polluting vessels , and at the same time, fishing opportunities in Europe are concentrated in the hands of the wealthier, industrial, high-impact fishing vessels, based on historical catch records ,, . Fisheries management in Europe favours the large-scale, high-impact operators, a subsector that is causing environmental harm, driving overfishing and significantly contributing to the climate crisis.

The key to dealing with the critical state of EU fisheries and unlocking the potential of SSF is Article 17 of the CFP, which has lain dormant this past decade. By applying transparent and objective criteria of an environmental, social and economic nature to the allocation of fishing opportunities, Article 17 should reward sustainable practices and encourage a shift to more sustainable, low-impact fishing ,,, . The current focus on catch history as the basis for allocating fishing opportunities is deeply flawed, encouraging fishing companies to prioritise quantity over quality , . Allocating the lion’s share of fishing opportunities to members of Fish Producer Organizations (FPOs) discriminates against smaller, low-impact fishing operators that don&#39;t meet high-catch volume requirements of most FPOs. Promoting sustainability in fishing allocation relies on addressing overfishing through the precautionary approach outlined in Article 2 of the CFP.

Additionally, by redirecting public money spent on harmful capacity-enhancing subsidies for larger-scale, high-impact fishing, the EU should support those within the fisheries sector who provide the greatest benefits for society and the environment and restore degraded marine ecosystems.

We, therefore, call on the Commission to:

* Establish a detailed and binding implementation plan for Article 17 along with clear guidelines on how to develop and apply  transparent and objective criteria to reward sustainable fishing practices and protect ecosystems and local communities;
* Integrate regular environmental and socio-economic impact assessment criteria into fishing opportunity allocation processes, in an adaptive co-management framework that includes with the
meaningful engagement of stakeholders from the small-scale fisheries sector, scientists and civil society;
* End harmful subsidies to larger-scale, high-impact fleets and Fund and prioritise small-scale low-impact fishing activities, while ending harmful subsidies to large-scale, high-impact fleets. In
particular:
  * support SSF associations to form dedicated Producer Organisations and marketing structures;
  * support the decarbonisation of the sector through the development of the most appropriate technology and infrastructure, including prioritising short supply chains;
  * increase the share and widen the scope of the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) used to promote nature restoration and regenerative practices;
* Ensure the processes of fisheries subsidies and fishing opportunities allocation are fully transparent and publicly accessible through the release of EC-level annual reports outlining how
fishing opportunities and subsidies were allocated and to whom.

These actions, which we are asking you to implement,  have become not only environmental but also socio-economic imperatives. The European Commission must urgently rethink fisheries management to drive a just transition away from an extractive industry supporting high-impact, large-scale fishing, towards one that champions low-impact, small-scale fisheries as guardians of the ocean.
